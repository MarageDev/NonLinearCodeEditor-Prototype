  <h1 align="center">Non Linear Code Editor ( NLCE ) </h1>
  <h3>
    A prototype code editor that aims to give the user the possibility to visually adjust/edit/organize its code 
  </h3>
  <h6>This is still an early prototype built in Godot to find possible workflow issues and other ways to improve it</h6>

# Description
NLCE lets you load code files from any language with the proper syntax highlighting (you can even create your own) and display it as blocks that are automatically separated in the window (an option to manually separate the file will be available in the future).

This allows to have a more visual approach of a file and organize with comments and frames your code to make it easier to work with, this is especially useful for large files containing a lot of lines.

## State of Art

The only mention of a Non-linear code editor I have seen online was from the blog *Anonymous Function* which contained the article published in 2013 by *Benedict Singer*: http://www.anonymous-function.net/articles/non-linear-code-editing/

> ***Note :*** I have not seen it before starting the project, but the reasoning and ideas under the <i>A new proposal</i> header are also the ones that drove me to work on this project.</h6>
